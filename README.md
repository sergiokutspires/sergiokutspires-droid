<h1>Hi, I'm Sérgio!</h1>

<h3>Data Science Student @ NOVA IMS</h3>

<p>
I’m driven by ambition, intellectual hunger, and long-term vision.
</p>

<p>
I care about understanding how things actually work, especially intelligence, data, and the systems behind them. Right now I’m building technical depth in data engineering, AI, and cybersecurity, while figuring out where I want to go deep.

I’m curious about many things, but I’m serious about mastering the ones I commit to.
